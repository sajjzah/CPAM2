// - The new line after #include <stdio.h> is essential because directives are known as
// one line command and everything in this line will be known as directive.
// (that's why we don't put ; at the end of directives: they don't need that!)
// - The spaces between data type (int) and identifires (main, height) are essential because
// otherwise they'll got mixed together and produce new (and meaningless) token.
// - The space between "return 0". the reason is same as the above.
