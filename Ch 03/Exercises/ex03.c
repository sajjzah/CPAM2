// (a): Equivalent: compiler will skip all the blanks
//      before the number in both strings.
// (b): Different: in the first one after reading first number
//      compiler tries to immediately match - with the input.
//      i.e. the second one allows blanks before matching -
// (c): Different: The second format string causes program to
//      skip all blank inputs after reading number (including
//      new line) and wait for a non-blank input.
// (d): Equivalent: both skip the blanks after comma.
