// It's legal but doesn't have the meaning stated in printf function.
// the program first check if n in greater than or equal to 1. the result is
// 0 or 1. the checks if the result is less than or equal to 10. if it is,
// prints the string. so when n = 5, (n >= 1) will be true (1). and then
// (1 <= 10) will be true. so printf function will be executed.
// In fact, for any value of n, the if statement will be executed.
